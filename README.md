# FOS-DeAnza-Web
This is an event site I developed for De Anza FOS club. The website is built using [React](https://react.dev/). The website is hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

Website URL: [https://deanzafos.club/](https://deanzafos.club/)

## Getting Started (for developer)
To get started, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once you have Node.js installed, you can run the following commands to get started.

```bash
# Clone the repository to local machine
git clone  

# Install dependencies
npm install 

# Run the web application
npm start
```
